# UI design exercise
I created this UI design with Minna Katermaa for a school project in the HÃ¤me university of applied sciences. The UI design application we used was Figma, and we utilised also a free Android Nougat GUI (not strictly) and Font Awesome.

The application is designed for an Android phone with a resolution of 360 x 640 px and the UI design consists of ten frames.

## About the application the UI is made for
The UI is for an imaginary application for a Rocket Science sports club to borrow sports equipment. The users of this application are all tech-savvy adults who are used to work with computers and different kind of applications. 

More info about the UI is in the PDF file in Finnish. The PDF file also includes as a Figma link to the UI. I'll update the info later here in English.
